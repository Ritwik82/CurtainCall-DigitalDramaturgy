🎭 CurtainCall: A Digital Dramaturgy


CurtainCall is a narrative-driven CTF experience where the world of cybersecurity meets the dramatic flair of a Shakespearean tragedy. The kingdom's defensive enchantments have been twisted into poetic riddles, and you must progress through the scenes of a fragmented play to reclaim the "Golden Flags".

📖 The Story of the Play
Act I: The Star-Crossed Scroll A cowled messenger departs into the fog, leaving a scrap of weathered parchment pinned to the gates. The ink shimmers with celestial light, but the words are twisted. To enter the inner sanctum, you must untangle this "thirteen times cursed" celestial knot.

Act II: The Sentinel’s Logic Standing before the Vault of Archives is the Sentinel—a figure of shadow who seeks a "Universal Truth". He refuses entry to any who cannot bypass the very concept of a lock by providing an identity that is, by its own nature, always valid.

Act III: The Stained Portrait In the Long Gallery, the portrait of Lady Portia hides secrets within the very essence of its pigments. While it appears as simple oil and canvas to the common observer, a master of forensics will find data hidden within the margins of its creation.

Act IV: The Alchemist’s Vigor In a laboratory lit by emerald flames, a cauldron bubbles with a "Binary Potion" reflecting ones and zeros. To claim the final flag, you must unweave the compiled spells and find the raw strings of reality embedded in the potion's soul.
