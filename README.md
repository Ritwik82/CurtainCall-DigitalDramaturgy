🎭 CurtainCall: A Digital Dramaturgy
CurtainCall is a theatrical-themed web interface designed to host a narrative-driven digital challenge. It uses a dramatic, high-contrast aesthetic to guide users through a series of "Acts."

🎬 The Narrative
The webpage functions as a digital stage where the story of a kingdom in turmoil unfolds across four scenes:

Prologue: The entrance to the fortress, where a "thirteen times cursed" scroll awaits.

Act I: The King’s Ledger, guarded by a gatekeeper who demands a "universal truth."

Act II: The Gallery, where a portrait of Portia hides secrets within its very makeup.

Act III: The Alchemist’s Lab, containing a binary potion that must be unspun.
