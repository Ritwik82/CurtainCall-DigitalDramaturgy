Here is the refined README.md for CurtainCall: A Digital Dramaturgy. This version focuses purely on the narrative, the "vibe" of the play, and the instructions on how to interact with the challenge environment.

🎭 CurtainCall: A Digital Dramaturgy
Welcome to the stage. CurtainCall is a narrative-driven CTF experience where the world of cybersecurity meets the dramatic flair of a Shakespearean tragedy. The Kingdom of Bit-stratford is in turmoil, and only a master of the "Digital Arts" can restore the light.

📖 The Backstory: The Silence of the Bard
In the silicon-fortress of Bit-stratford, the King’s most vital secrets—his "Golden Flags"—have been spirited away by a rogue knave known only as The Glitch.

The kingdom's defensive enchantments have been twisted into poetic riddles. You play the role of the Noble Scrivener, a code-breaking scholar summoned to the royal court. Your task is to progress through the scenes of a fragmented play, deciphering the narrative to reclaim what was stolen.

🎭 The Story of the Play
Prologue: The Whispering Gates
The play begins at the threshold of the fortress. The air is thick with "Rotation." You encounter a messenger who speaks in a tongue that seems familiar yet garbled. He carries a scroll that he claims is "thirteen times cursed." To enter the castle, you must find the meaning behind his madness.

Act I: The Ghost in the Machine
Within the castle walls, you find the King’s Ledger, but it is guarded by a spectral Gatekeeper who only understands "True" or "False." He demands a credential you do not possess. You must find a way to trick the logic of the spectral wall using the language of the Void.

Act II: The Merchant’s Secret
In the marketplace of the kingdom, you find a portrait of the fair Portia. Rumor has it that Shylock has hidden a "pound of data" not behind the frame, but within the very essence of the image itself. You must peer into the properties of the art to find the hidden truth.

Act III: The Alchemist’s Brew
The climax takes place in the Alchemist's lab. A strange "Binary Potion" sits on the table. To find the final Flag, you must unweave the spell that brewed it. You are tasked with looking at the soul of the potion—the very instructions that make it run—to see the world in reverse.

🛠️ The Setup (How to Solve)
To engage with this drama and solve the puzzles presented on the screen, follow these instructions:

The Interface: Navigate the webpage at your hosted URL. Use the Action Buttons (e.g., "Enter the Scene") to move the story forward.

The Hidden Clues: Look for Character Spotlights (clickable elements). These will provide bits of dialogue that serve as the "flavor text" for your investigation.

The Files: Some acts may require you to inspect files provided in the repository (such as the image in the img/ folder or the binary mentioned in the narrative).

The Submission: As you uncover the secret "Flags" (formatted as FLAG{...}), keep them safe. In a full competition setting, these would be entered into your scoreboard.

📜 Stage Directions
Observe the Text: The Shakespearean dialogue isn't just for show—the solution methods are often hinted at through puns and archaic metaphors.

The Browser is Your Lens: Use the "Inspect Element" tool to look at the stage's construction if you feel a ghost is hiding in the code.

Patience is a Virtue: Like any great play, the resolution comes to those who watch closely.
